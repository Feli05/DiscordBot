# DiscordBot

Discord bot developed on Python!

Uses youtubeDL to play music on voice channels and has the Giphy API integrated. Some of its features include: play music, send GIFs and other actions.

Currently working on new features such as: integrating Spotify API to display the information about the artist/track requested by the user.

*Make sure that if you want to use this code you must have a python script called **config.py** that contains the API keys!*
